## Bio

I grew up in Gordon, Nebraska, but I've been living in South Dakota for the past ten years. I have two daughters that are two and 4, that occupy most of my time. I recently finished my Associates in Pre-engineering, I'll be graduating in may. I plan to finish a Physics degree at SDSM&T begining this fall.
