## Bio

I grew up in Gordon, Nebraska, but I've been living in South Dakota for the past ten years. I have two daughters that are two and 4, that occupy most of my time. I like to read and play the guitar. I recently finished my Associates in Pre-engineering, I'll be graduating in may. I plan to finish a Physics degree at SDSM&T begining this fall. I spent last summer working in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in support of Neutrino and Dark Matter detectors, and am interested in quantum and astrophysics.

I took an Intro to Python class last semester, I found the subject fascinating but the class itself was lacking. I learned some basics, but im excited to really learn programming and data management as i feel they will be important for my future work.
